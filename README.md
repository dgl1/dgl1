I am a Reader in the [philosophy department](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy/) at University College London where I have taught since 2015. Before coming to UCL, I was John L. Loeb Associate Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University. I earned my PhD in philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh. I work in practical philosophy, especially ethics, history of ethics and action theory.
